								<p> Hi! I'm Britney, or Brit if you prefer! I am an aspiring Web Developer learning all there is to know about
									coding and programming at Lambda School with their wonderful Full Stack Web Development course. Before Lambda
									the only coding experience I had was cheat codes for video games, specifically The Sims 2-4. Unless you count 
									MySpace days where everyone was creating cool profile designs and embedded music links. That being said,
									I have already learned so much in my first 3 weeks and am quite proud of what I am accomplishing and have
									accomplished so far! From passing my first Sprint Challenge with flying colors, to beginning creation of my 
									own portfolio site designed completely by me, I am loving learning to code and am so happy to have found this 
									amazing opportunity with Lambda School! <br><br> More about me, who I am, and what led me to where I am can be
									found in the <a href="#about">"About" section</a> of this site! However, the purpose of this site is to have
									a place to showcase my <a href="#work">work</a> and show off what I've been learning! Please, take 
									a moment to explore some of the great sites located on my <a href="#work">work page</a>! If you'd like me to
									create something awesome for you or your company, please feel free to contact me via the 
									<a href="#contact">Contact page</a>. I look forward to hearing from you and being a part of your projects!

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<h3>About who I am</h3><p>Born in Adel, GA and raised in Seale, AL, I am a southern woman with big dreams.
									I've been through many things in life but I refuse to let it define who I am like it did for many years.
									I have broken then chains that use to hold me back from years of bullying and abuse in school, and I am embracing life.
									<br> As the oldest of 4, plus many other "adopted" and foster siblings, I know what its like to be a part of a large
									family unit. We didn't have much in the way of material things but we had everything you could ask for and more when it
									comes to the family aspects of love, friendship, and nurturing. Though there were struggles, I was raised by the best
									parents a girl could ask for.			
								</p>

								<h3>Present</h3><p>Currently I am a Full Stack Web Development student at Lambda School.
								When I am not in class I can be found working my full time job as a remote tech support
								advisor, practicing code, or relaxing with my significant other and our furbies. I am interviewing
								for a promotion within my current job soon and am confident that I will do well. I love writing,
								photography, reading, and relaxing every chance I get (What's sleep anyhow??) </p>
								
								<h3>Past</h3><p> I graduated high school in 2008 with honors and an Advanced HS Diploma. I went to a local 
								community college on music scholarship for band (saxophonist) and majored in Liberal Arts. I did quite well 
								and ended up on the Dean's List twice and Phi Theta Kappa, but I didn't feel fulfilled. In fact, as much as 
								I enjoyed the school and the friends I made there, I felt bogged down and overwhelmed with all the extra classes
								I was required to take for my scholarship, for graduation credits, and for my major. With all those classes,
								I spent more than 12 hours a day on campus (which was a 15-20 minute drive from my home) and rarely had time
								for breaks or social life. I even worked at the campus bookstore because it was the only way to have a job
								that was guaranteed to work with my insane schedule.
								<br> After a few semesters, I transfered to an online art school in 2010 that I felt would be better for me. It wasn't.
								Internet access was harder to come by than I thought it would be and I found myself unable to avoid distractions
								at that time in my life. I decided to leave that school in late 2010 and went to a technical college for Denatl Assistant.
								Although I loved the program, life did not like this change. It was located 45 minutes from home, I kept having
								car/ride issues, my new job cut hours for the season so I was only working 5 hours a week, and my student loan debt
								was increasing steadily.
								<br> I decided it was time to take a break from schooling and focus on other things in life. I got into the work force
								in 2012 and speant some years getting some work under my belt and just getting life together. In 2013 I became a caregiver
								for my grandmother full time until she passed in August 2015. I then took a year for myself (luckily I was still living
								with my parents who allowed me to do as I wished while I figured life out) and made money freelancing as a transcriptionist
								for Rev.com. And in September 2016 I began working at a call center where I worked until March 2019 when I switched to my 
								current Remote Advisor call center job. 
								<br> Through all the years I knew I wanted to return to school and complete a degree or crtificate program that
								would help me have a better career, better life, and better financial stability. Making under $30,000/year just
								isn't the life I want to continue for myself and my family (which includes my significant other and our furbabies).
								With the crazy schedules I kept, I could never find time to return to school. Nothing fit into my life or my budget and I
								could not find a program that made me excited. Then I stumbled upon 
								<a href="https://lambdaschool.com"><img src="images/lambda.png" alt="Website Screenshot"></a>. 
								While scrolling on Facebook one night, I saw an add for a school that said mentioned that you could attend for free and not
								pay anything until you landed a job making $50,000+/year. Obviously this peaked my interest, as I thought "this is way too good
								to be true", I clicked the add and began to read about the school. I spent the next few weeks researching Lambda everywhere that
								I could find any information, with the best coming from YouTube and the school website. I decided to go ahead and sign up to try
								the free pre-course work in early September. I found out that the next class that fit my schedule began on October 28, 2019 and
								set my sites on starting class that day! I love the school and feel like I have FINALLY found something that fits me and the things
								I love to do! Creating awesome websites has always been something I found fascinating! Along with all different forms of
								digital art! So I know I have finally landed somewhere that will help me meet my full potential and goals!</p>
								
								<h3>Future</h3><p> I've only just begun my journey at Lambda and I am already super stoked to complete the program and earn my 
									endorsment! I have big dreams for the future, which include relocating out of Alabama! I'm not 100% sure where this career will
									take me, but I know that the future is bright and filled with lots and lots of code, thanks to 
									<a href="https://lambdaschool.com"><img src="images/lambda.png" alt="Website Screenshot"></a>!
									I look forward to embracing the amazing thinks coming my way!
